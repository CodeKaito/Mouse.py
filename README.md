# Random Mouse Movement

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to move the mouse pointer in a random pattern. The mouse movements are done using the `mouse` module, and the randomness is achieved using the `random` module.

## Installation

To run this script, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You also need to install the `mouse` module, which you can do using the following command:

```
pip install mouse
```

## Usage

To run the script, simply open a terminal window or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Then, enter the following command:

```
python random_mouse_movement.py
```

This will start the script and the mouse pointer will start moving randomly.

You can customize the range of the random movements by changing the `random.randint` parameters. For example, if you want the mouse to move in a larger area, you can increase the maximum and minimum x and y values.
